            <h2>Car Price Prediction Analysis</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Car Price Prediction Analysis</strong> project leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to provide accurate estimations of used car prices. This solution addresses the dynamic nature of the used car market, ensuring fairness and transparency in transactions between buyers and sellers.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>The primary goal is to develop a predictive model capable of analyzing various features of a vehicle to estimate its market value effectively. This empowers users to make informed decisions, enhancing trust in the automotive market.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Data and Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Sourced from Kaggle, including attributes like car name, brand, model, mileage, engine capacity, kilometers driven, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Addressed outliers, skewness, and missing values to ensure data quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Compared regression models like CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, and others. CatBoost Regressor achieved the highest accuracy with an R² score of 0.9437.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict used car prices with high accuracy.</li>
                <li>Analyzes influential factors such as car brand, model, year, mileage, and transmission type.</li>
                <li>Enables transparent pricing to bridge the gap between buyer and seller expectations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Results and Insights</h3>
            <p>The project demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble machine learning models like CatBoost and XGBoost over traditional methods. For instance, the model predicted the price of a 5-year-old Maruti Alto with 50,000 km driven at approximately ₹279,487.59. Such predictions validate the model's capability to provide actionable insights based on vehicle attributes.</p>
